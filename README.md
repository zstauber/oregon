Intended to be a BASIC port to JavaScript of the 1978 version of Oregon Trail

I've typed in the source code for Oregon Trail, the version from the Creative Computing magazine, 1978, May-June, volume 3, number 4.  However, it is written in a platform agnostic dialect of BASIC, and includes a few things that were simply not available in Applesoft BASIC at the time, such as a function called CLK which reads a current time from the system timer.  As far as I can tell, Applesoft BASIC did not have a clock function or any way of reading a system time.  JavaScript does, of course, but there is no way to validate it against a version that runs on an Apple II.  Anyway, the source will be called source.bas in the info directory.  Enjoy.
